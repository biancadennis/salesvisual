Submission for challenge. Composer.json and index.php files allow 'app' to be deployed to heroku. 

The last chart from the mockup was not included as I didn't see what the chart matched in the data file. This was skipped in the interest of time.

The salesByColor section in the data file was also changed so that the charts were able to automatically update with the colors. White Bar needs to be fixed to there is either a border, or the background is not white
